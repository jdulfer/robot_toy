This is the expected output for the test_instructions. I decided to not implement all of this
as a unit test as a) that was outside scope and b) this way you can easily modify the test test_instructions
without modifying the unit tests.

FIRST REPORT:
There is 1 robot active
Current active robot is 1
Robot number 1's location is: [0,1,NORTH]

Robot number 2's location is: [0,0,WEST]
THIRD REPORT:

Current active robot is 3
Robot number 1's location is: [0,1,NORTH]
Robot number 2's location is: [0,0,WEST]
Robot number 3's location is: [3,3,NORTH]
FOURTH REPORT (This report shouldn't change as I'm testing that the robot is ignoring invalid move commands):
There are 3 robots active
